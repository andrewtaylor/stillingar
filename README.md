# Stillingar

Stillingar is a configuration framework for Java applications. It supports runtime reloading of 
configuration files, which can consist of XML, JSON or properties files. When used in a Spring 
environment, configuration values can be autowired by expression or if XMLBeans/JAXB/Jackson2 
are used, by type.
